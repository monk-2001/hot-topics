The Internet will be in your contact lens. Imagine blinking, and then instantly going online, accessing your home office, or home entertainment system anywhere or anytime. Computers will disappear. We will be able to command these hidden computers telepathically, directly via the mind. Our cars will be driver-less, using GPS to navigate without the help of an alert human. Doctors will be able to grow “spare parts” for our organs as soon as they wear out. This will create a “human body shop.” The human life span will be extended. The robot industry will dwarf the size of the current automobile industry. Robots will be everywhere, performing dangerous and tedious tasks. Tourists will soar into outer space via the Space Elevator. With advanced technology also comes advanced dangers, especially biological warfare, nuclear proliferation, and global warming.</p>

<p>1. Get ready for another 4 billion people by 2100.
One that the UN mentions in its report is how fast the birth rate falls in countries where women currently have a lot of kids. The UN is expecting fertility to fall substantially, but that will hinge on things like investments in women’s health and expanded access to birth control.
<br>
2. That growth is mostly coming from one continent -- Africa.
The UN's projections for Africa are pretty mind-blowing. Africa is expected to more than double its population by 2100. Africa currently accounts for 16 percent of the global population. The UN expects that proportion to rise to 25 percent in 2050 and 49 percent by 2100.
<br>
3. Nigeria will soon become the world's third most populous country.Nigeria's population will be bigger than that of the U.S. before long. The country is expected to surpass America by about 2050 to become the third largest country in the world, the UN says. At that point, China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and the U.S. will all have populations of more than 300 million.
<br>
4. India will surpass China.Demography buffs may already know this one, but India is set to become the world's most populous country very soon. China now has 1.38 billion people, compared with 1.31 billion in India. By 2022, both countries will see their populations rise to 1.4 billion. After that, China's population will level off as its people age, but India will keep growing to 1.5 billion in 2030 and 1.7 billion in 2050.
<br>
5. Europe is getting really old. Right now, about a quarter of Europeans are 60 or older. That proportion will rise to a little more than a third in 2050 and 2100.</p>

<p>
In the 21st century so far, populous countries and strong population growth were most often associated with Asia – but this view of the world will have to change in the future, data by the United Nations and Pew Research Center shows.
<br>
While in 2020, five out of the ten most populous countries in the world were located in Asia, the picture will look different in 2100, when five African countries – Nigeria, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Egypt and the Democratic Republic of the Congo – will be among the world’s ten largest. While some Asian countries will continue to grow, they will do so at a lower rate and will be surpassed in population by African countries exhibiting faster growth. Others, like China and Bangladesh are actually expected to shrink until 2100, mainly a result of higher standard of living and education that has already begun to lower birth rates.In 1950, four European countries were still among the world’s largest. That number will have decreased to one in 2020 and none in 2100.The number of children born worldwide is already decreasing, but at currently 2.5 children born per woman, world population is still growing. UN population researchers found that if the global fertility rate kept dropping at the rate it currently is, it would reach 1.9 children per woman in 2100, at which point the world population would actually be decreasing.</p>
